### Race Predictor
The running race predictor estimates your 5K, 10K, half marathon and marathon times. In addition, you can upload your upcoming race .gpx file to get a custom prediction that takes course difficulty into account. 

### Training Volume
You can view your training load (total time, distance, number of workouts, time in training zones) for all activities, or for each activity individually. 

TrainaLyzer also provides a calendar-style overview of your past months training.
